What your site does and its purpose.
	My website is called Linknote, and its goal is to help people find websites, as well as store them.

What part of your app does the API handle?
	Store links and get links.
	
What went right and what went wrong?
	I don't think anything has gone in the wrong direction, and so far the overall functionality has met my expectations.

If you were to continue, what would you do to improve your app?
	I will add the ability to sort by color and the ability for users to give links a tag.

How did you go above and beyond?
	I think I did a good job with my CSS, and I spent a long time designing it.
